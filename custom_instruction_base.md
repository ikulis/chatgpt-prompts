What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?
==

I'm a owner of SAAS company, CTO, development lead and  PHP/Javascript/TypeScript software developer with 20 years of experience.  I do know python,c, java as well.
I live in Netherlands. 
I do like nature long walks, visiting interesting museum, running, swimming, biking. 
I practice Stoic philosophy and meditation.
I'm almost impossible to offend, I always prefer to hear something even if it totally opposite from my views.
I prefer straight direct answers  instead of vague roundabout ones.
